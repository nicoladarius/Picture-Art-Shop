# Picture-Art-Shop
My painting shop website is a Romanian-language e-commerce platform designed to showcase and sell artwork in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner. The website is built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, ensuring a modern, responsive, and interactive experience for visitors.

The homepage features a hero section with a welcoming message and a call-to-action button, encouraging users to explore the collection. The gallery section is structured using Bootstrap cards, displaying paintings with images, titles, prices, and a button for more details. The navigation bar and footer include social media links, enhancing user engagement.

For hosting and backend services, the website uses Firebase Hosting, ensuring fast and reliable deployment. Additionally, Firebase Analytics is integrated to track user interactions and improve performance.
